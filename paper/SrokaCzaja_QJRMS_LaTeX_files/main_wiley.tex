\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    Western boundary currents exhibit significant meandering on sub-seasonal timescales and wavelenghts of a few hundreds of kilometers, but the extent to which the ocean\\ mesoscale eddy activity associated with these motions can enhance the turbulent air-sea heat flux averaged over a large spatial domain has not been fully characterized. This study aims to quantify the enhancement of the winter time mean sensible and latent heat flux from ocean mesoscale eddies in reanalysis data. Results from a correlation analysis between eddy activity, using sea surface height anomaly data as a proxy, and the winter time mean heat fluxes do not suggest that there are broad correlations from winter-to-winter over the 2003-2018 period. The results from simple models designed to isolate the contributions from the eddies suggest that the eddy-enhancement of the heat flux is small compared to the long-time, large-spatial scale mean in the reanalysis data, perhaps due to a lack of mesoscale sea surface temperature activity in the reanalysis data.
