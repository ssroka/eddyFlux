@article{Nayar2016,
abstract = {In a previous paper, the authors have given correlations for seawater thermophysical properties as functions of temperature and salinity, but only for near atmospheric pressures. Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) systems operate routinely at pressures of 6 MPa or more; however, experimental data for seawater properties at elevated pressures (P = 0.1-12 MPa) are limited to a salinity of 56 g/kg. To accurately model and design SWRO and thermal desalination systems, a reliable method of estimating the effect of pressure on seawater properties is required. In this work, we present this method and new correlations for seawater thermophysical properties that are valid within the range: t = 0-120 °C, S = 0-120 g/kg, and P = 0-12 MPa. Seawater isothermal compressibility data, available until a salinity of 56 g/kg, were used to develop a correlation for compressibility that is extrapolated to 160 g/kg. Thermodynamic identities were then used to develop accurate pressure dependent correlations for seawater: density, isobaric expansivity, specific heat capacity, enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs energy. New correlations were proposed for seawater: vapor pressure, thermal conductivity and activity of water. Recent work on seawater surface tension and osmotic coefficient were reviewed. Uncertainty bounds were calculated for each correlation.},

Air-sea interaction over sea surface temperature fronts throughout the world ocean is evident in both the curl and divergence fields, as are the influences of islands and coastal mountains. Ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream generate distinctive patterns in the curl field. These previously unresolved features have important implications for oceanographic and air-sea interaction research.},

abstract = {Air–sea interaction at ocean fronts and eddies exhibits positive correlation between sea surface temperature (SST), wind speed, and heat fluxes out of the ocean, indicating that the ocean is forcing the atmosphere. This contrasts with larger scale climate modes where the negative correlations suggest that the atmosphere is driving the system. This paper examines the physical processes that lie behind the interaction of sharp SST gradients and the overlying marine atmospheric boundary layer and deeper atmosphere, using high resolution satellite data, field data and numerical models. The importance of different physical mechanisms of atmospheric response to SST gradients, such as the effect of surface stability variations on momentum transfer, pressure gradients, secondary circulations and cloud cover will be assessed. The atmospheric response is known to create small-scale wind stress curl and divergence anomalies, and a discussion of the feedback of these features onto the ocean will also be presented. These processes will be compared and contrasted for different regions such as the Equatorial Front in the Eastern Pacific, and oceanic fronts in mid-latitudes such as the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio, and Agulhas Return Current.}
