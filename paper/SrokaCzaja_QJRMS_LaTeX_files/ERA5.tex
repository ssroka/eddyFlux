The ERA5 reanalysis data (\citet{ERA5_data,hersbach2020era5}; downloaded from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store) was extracted at a 0.25$^{\circ}$ spatial resolution and at a 6-hour temporal resolution for the boreal winter months December through March (DJFM). The region considered is a patch of the Northwest Pacific Ocean (30$^\circ$N to 41.5$^\circ$N,142.5$^\circ$E to 169$^\circ$E) that captures the major features of the Kuroshio Extension. The reanalysis fields include the sea surface temperature ($\To$), the temperature at 2\,m ($\Ta$), the surface pressure ($p_0$), the dew point temperature at 2\,m ($T_d$), the surface wind vector ($[u,v]$), the surface sensible heat flux ($Q_s$) and the surface latent heat flux ($Q_L$). \par
