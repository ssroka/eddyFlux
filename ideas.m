% use SST to get CD
% define a u
% compute tau
% use tau to get the fluxes by correlating the wind stress curl and wind
% stress to 
% need to try to find an increase of about 10% or 10 W/m^2 in total energy
% flux so if the eddies cause an increase by 10% versus not being there
% then maybe that's part of the result
